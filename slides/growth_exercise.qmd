## Studying reading and motivational development in two risk groups

-   sample downloadable from homepage (left margin) of elementary school children through grades 1-3
-   Two outcome measures: se (self-efficacy) and lf (listening comprehension)
-   Two groups of children (variable dlf)
    -   PoorD = "Poor decoders, ok comprehension"
    -   PoorC = "Poor comprehension, ok decoding"

Read data (uses the compact R file format .rds )

```{r}
library(lavaan); library(tidyverse)
mydata <- readRDS("../data/growth_reading.rds")
head(mydata)
```

## Inspecting data: descriptives

```{r}
library(gtsummary)
mydata %>% tbl_summary(by = dlf, missing_text="missing",
              statistic = list(all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})")) 
```

## Missing data!

```{r}
library(naniar) # visualize missingness
vis_miss(mydata)
```

Missing data can be categorized into three main types: **MCAR**, **MAR**, and **MNAR**.

## Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)

When data are MCAR, missingness is unrelated to both observed and unobserved data, meaning no systematic differences exist between those with and without missing values.

**Example:** Lab samples are lost due to a processing error. MCAR reduces sample size but does not introduce bias. However, it is a strong and often unrealistic assumption.

## Missing at Random (MAR)

When data are MAR, missingness depends on observed data but not on the missing values themselves.

**Example:** In a depression study, men may be less likely to complete a survey, but missingness is unrelated to depression severity. Complete case analysis may be biased, but adjusting for observed factors (e.g., sex) can correct this.

The *fiml* estimator in lavaan is commonly used to handle missingness, under the assumption of R. Full-information means that we do not throw away any data points. Using the default estimator means listwise deletion.

## Missing Not at Random (MNAR)

When data are MNAR, missingness is related to unobserved data, meaning the reason for missing data is itself unknown.

**Example:** People with severe depression may be less likely to complete a survey. Because the cause of missingness is unmeasured, bias is likely and difficult to correct.

## Exercises 

1.  find the correlation matrix for se1-se2-se3 ? hint: *cor()*

2.  find the correlation between lf1 and se1? interpret the sign and magnitude

3.  what is the effect of *dlf* on *lf1*? hint: use *lm()*. interpret the estimates

4.  make a spagettiplot of 25 random students for the growth in *se*

5.  estimate a linear growth model (without covariates) for *lf*.

6.  What is the model fit of the growth model? hint: use *fitmeasures()*

7.  As in (5) but use *estimator="fiml"* to handle missingness. Do the substantive conclusions change?

8.  Make histograms for the *lf* variables. Do the data appear normally distributed?

9.  Run the model with covariates: use dlf as predictor for slope and intercept. Interpret the effect of the predictor

10. plot the path diagram of model from exc. 9.
